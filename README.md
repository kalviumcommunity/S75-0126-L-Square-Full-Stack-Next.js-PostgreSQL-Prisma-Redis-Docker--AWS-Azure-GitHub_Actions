# Transparent Intercity Bus Ticket Cancellation & Refund System

## Overview
Intercity bus ticket cancellations and refunds are often unclear, inconsistent, and difficult for passengers to track. This project aims to build an **open and transparent full-stack platform** that standardizes cancellation policies, explains refund calculations clearly, and provides real-time refund tracking to improve trust and accountability in public transport systems.

---

## Problem Statement
Intercity bus ticket cancellations and refunds are opaque and inconsistent. Passengers face unclear policies, hidden deductions, delayed refunds, and lack of accountability from operators. This results in low trust and frequent disputes.

---

## Project Goal
To design and implement a transparent, verifiable system that:
- Clearly displays cancellation and refund policies  
- Explains refund calculations step-by-step  
- Tracks refund status in real time  
- Maintains an audit trail for accountability  

---

## Key Features
- **Policy Transparency:** Publicly visible, standardized cancellation and refund rules  
- **Ticket Cancellation Workflow:** Simple and clear cancellation process  
- **Refund Breakdown:** Detailed explanation of refund amount and deductions  
- **Real-Time Tracking:** Track refund status from request to completion  
- **Audit Logs:** Immutable logs of all cancellation and refund actions  
- **Admin/Operator Dashboard:** Manage policies, refunds, and compliance  

---

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript)  
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **ORM:** Prisma  
- **Caching:** Redis  
- **Containerization:** Docker  
- **Cloud Deployment:** AWS / Azure
